# Healthcare_SQL_Project
This project simulates a Hospital Management System using a structured, multi-table relational database.  

The goal is to practice SQL skills such as:
- Database design (schema + relationships)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Data exploration and aggregation
- Business insights using joins, subqueries, and window functions

The dataset is synthetically generated and includes patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing information.
